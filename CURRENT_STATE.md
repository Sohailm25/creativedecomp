# Current State

**Status:** in_progress
**Current phase:** Phase 0 - Standalone scaffold locked

## Active Thesis Lock

- `known`: this workspace is now a standalone git repository with remote `git@github.com:Sohailm25/creativedecomp.git`.
- `known`: the active task branch is `wip/creativedecomp-scaffold-lock`.
- `known`: `bd` is initialized locally; `creativedecomp-bql` is closed, and the next ready tasks are `creativedecomp-1ie` and `creativedecomp-9cm`.
- `known`: the primary experiment is `creativity direction -> SAE feature decomposition -> feature-level validation`, not the broader controller and basin-hopping ideas.
- `known`: the strongest default implementation path is `google/gemma-2-2b` plus GemmaScope `65K` residual SAEs on local MPS; narrower SAE widths remain method-specific pilot options, not the base configuration.
- `known`: the main methodological risk is naive SAE decomposition of a dense steering vector; signed, contrastive, or pursuit-based decomposition is mandatory.
- `known`: the strongest novelty framing is explaining why creativity is mechanistically different from simpler behavioral concepts such as refusal and sentiment.
- `known`: input-feature and output-feature separation is a hard requirement for any claim about creativity features.
- `known`: output-feature filtering is part of the planned primary path, not an optional cleanup step.
- `known`: cross-domain bridge features are in scope, but only as a tested hypothesis after the base decomposition lane is live.
- `known`: the experiment has an explicit publishable negative result path if creativity turns out to be more distributed or decomposition-resistant than simpler behavioral concepts.
- `known`: the local operating files now exist for state tracking, preregistration, session logging, result indexing, validation code, and tracked empty directories that survive fresh clones.
- `known`: the final rigor audit is landed in `history/20260318-final-rigor-audit.md` and `results/infrastructure/20260318-final-rigor-audit.md`.
- `known`: no remaining structural differences from `resattn` look detrimental to execution rigor; the remaining differences are experiment-specific lanes and source documents.
- `known`: the full local test suite is currently green, including scaffold structure, helper-script parsing, core-doc baggage checks, AGENTS rigor coverage, and novelty-alignment checks.

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Freeze a minimal local environment for the first replication slice.
2. Curate the first creative versus uncreative prompt set, then freeze the pilot/confirm split before tuning layer or scale.
3. Implement the smallest creativity-direction extraction smoke on Gemma 2 2B and use the pilot slice to freeze layer choice and steering scale.
4. Compare at least two legal signed decomposition methods on the pilot slice before freezing the confirm path.
5. Lock a two-family benchmark bundle plus matched refusal/sentiment baseline plans so the "mechanistically different" framing stays testable.
